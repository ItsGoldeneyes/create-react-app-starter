# scryforme

This is a web app that allows you to link to Scryfall searches in a debatably less user-friendly way. 

## Usage

The app ~~is~~ will be hosted at [https://scryforme.com](https://scryforme.com).

The page at the root URL is used to generate links to Scryfall searches. To generate a search link, enter the search query in the text box and click the "Generate Link" button. The generated link will be displayed below the button.
 - The page will also provide pointers on Scryfall syntax usage, parsed from the input string.
 - The page will also provide a list of recent searches, which can be clicked to generate a link to that search.

The generated query will link to a letmescryfallthat.com URL that will direct the user to a Scryfall search results page after clicking a button.

Eventually, I would like to add an AI that can generate a search query from text input, but this is a long-term goal.
